=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::SpecialAction::Trail - Support for the 'trail' special action

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # enabling the 'trail' special action in a single controller:

  package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

  use Moose;
  use namespace::autoclean;

  extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

  with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::SpecialAction::Trail';

  sub trail : Private {
    my ($self, $c, @args) = (shift, shift, @_);

    ...
  }

  # globally enabling the 'trail' special action:

  package MyApp;

  use Moose;
  use namespace::autoclean;

  extends 'Catalyst';

  __PACKAGE__->setup(qw/ SpecialAction::Trail /);

  # now you can use 'trail' in any controller in your app

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is ALPHA SOFTWARE. Use at your own risk. Features may change.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module introduces a new special action C<trail> that unites the features
of C<end> and C<auto> special actions (see L<Catalyst::Manual::Intro/"Built-in
special actions">):

=over

=item *

Like C<end>, the C<trail> actions will be run at the end of the request, after
all URL-matching actions are called; but they are called before any C<end> is
run.

=item *

Like C<auto>, multiple C<trail> actions will be run in turn, starting with the
application class and going through to the most specific controller class, and
the processing chain stops if any of them returns false (any remaining C<trail>
actions are skipped and the control goes to C<end> if there's any).

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 setup_component

Overridden (with an 'after' method modifier) from L<Catalyst/setup_component>.
Applies the L<Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::SpecialAction::Trail> role to
C<Catalyst::Controller>.

=cut

after setup_component => sub {
  my ($class) = @_;

  my $meta = Catalyst::Controller->meta;
  my $immutable_options = $meta->is_immutable ? { $meta->immutable_options }
                                              : undef;

  $meta->make_mutable if $immutable_options;
  ensure_all_roles('Catalyst::Controller',
    'Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::SpecialAction::Trail');

  $meta->make_immutable(%$immutable_options) if $immutable_options;
};
